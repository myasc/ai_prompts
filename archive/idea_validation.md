Act as a expert market researcher.

Focus on the primary pain paint that this solution solves. 

Browser the web and conduct a competitor research. 
Look for direct competitor how does the same thing i do using the same methods i'm deploying to solve
the problem.

Also look for indirect competitor, which means tools which are being used to solve the same problem
i wish to solve but using a different approach, more like hacking their way to the same solution by using
multiple tools.

After that look at the total addressable market. and find opportunities in a certain niche where
a more specific solution can be built.
